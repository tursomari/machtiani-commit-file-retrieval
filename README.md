Code retieval.

## Idea

Every commit message is generated by the following:

1. Diff the changes

2. A prompt that asks to give a concise and informative git commit message.

3. Use the answer as the git commit message.

**indexing of commit messages**

You embed and index all commit messages against the effected files.

```
   {
     <commit-message-embedding>: [<files>, ..]
     <commit-message-embedding>: [<files>, ..]
     <commit-message-embedding>: [<files>, ..]
   }
```

**file retrieval**

Embed the prompt, and find related files based on matching `alpha embeddings`.

**answer prompt**

Structure prompt something like this.

```
{pre-prompt}\n{prompt}\n{post-prompt}\n(files}
```
